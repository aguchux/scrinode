# 0. Document Authority

**AGENTS.md is the single source of truth for Scrinode.**

The `./docs` directory holds **parts** — specifications, plans and references covering portions of the product. More will be added over time. They are supporting material, not competing authorities.

Rules:

- Where a document in `./docs` conflicts with AGENTS.md, **AGENTS.md is correct** and the doc is stale.
- After an architectural change, update AGENTS.md first. Do not attempt to synchronise every document in `./docs`.
- A `./docs` file may be superseded in part without being rewritten. Note it and move on.
- New specifications, plans and design documents go in `./docs`.
- README.md is kept aligned with AGENTS.md, as the entry point for collaborators.

If you are an agent reading only one document before making changes, read this one.

# 1. Mission

Scrinode is a mobile-first, AI-powered Bible platform for preachers, teachers, Bible scholars, ministry teams, students, and serious readers of Scripture.

The product must enable users to move naturally through:

```text
READ
  ↓
SELECT
  ↓
STUDY
  ↓
ASK ZEDEK
  ↓
VERIFY
  ↓
SAVE
  ↓
BUILD
  ↓
PREACH / TEACH / LEARN
```

Scrinode is not a generic chatbot with Bible data attached.

The Bible itself is the foundational interface.

All research, original-language tools, cross-references, historical context, AI assistance, workspaces, and saved knowledge must remain anchored to Scripture.

---

# 2. Agent Prime Directives

Every agent working on Scrinode must follow these priorities in order:

1. **Preserve biblical-text primacy.**
2. **Do not fabricate sources, lexical claims, cross-references, historical facts, or citations.**
3. **Prefer structured data over LLM memory.**
4. **Keep Scripture, interpretation, AI synthesis, and user-generated content visibly distinct.**
5. **Design mobile-first, but never mobile-only.**
6. **Keep the five primary product domains coherent: Scripture, Study, Zedek, Work, Library.** The admin backoffice (§51) is a separate internal application, not a sixth domain.
7. **Do not introduce unnecessary infrastructure complexity before product need exists.**
8. **Build abstractions that allow future growth without overengineering the MVP.**
9. **Treat source provenance and licensing as first-class data.**
10. **Optimize for clarity, reliability, speed, and maintainability over novelty.**
11. **Prefer composable domain primitives over generic abstractions.**
12. **Do not silently make theological conclusions where multiple major interpretations exist.**
13. **Maintain accessibility as a product requirement, not a post-launch task.**
14. **Protect user data, research history, workspaces, and account state.**
15. **Every major feature must have a clean path from MVP implementation to future expansion.**

---

# 3. Core Product Architecture

Scrinode has five primary domains:

```text
SCRIPTURE
STUDY
ZEDEK
WORK
LIBRARY
```

These are the canonical user-facing areas.

## 3.1 Scripture

The Bible reader and navigation core.

Responsibilities:

- Genesis-to-Revelation reading.
- Book/chapter/verse navigation.
- Search.
- Translation switching.
- Verse and passage selection.
- Copy / quote.
- Compare translations.
- Highlight / save.
- Scripture-aware actions.

## 3.2 Study

Structured research around Scripture.

Responsibilities:

- Context.
- Cross-references.
- Original languages.
- Morphology.
- Lemmas.
- Word studies.
- Themes.
- People.
- Places.
- Events.
- Literary structure.
- Historical and cultural context.
- Ancient-world data.
- Canonical relationships.

## 3.3 Zedek

Scrinode's Scripture-grounded AI research assistant.

Responsibilities:

- Explain.
- Compare.
- Research.
- Converse.
- Trace themes.
- Explore language.
- Help synthesize.
- Support sermon and study development.
- Cite Scripture and identifiable research sources.

Zedek is an assistant, not a spiritual authority.

### Zedek is a domain *and* an application

Zedek is one of the five domains (§4's navigation contract is unchanged) and
also `apps/zedek`, a standalone research workspace at `zedek.scrinode.com`.
Both surfaces exist deliberately: the reader's Zedek tab answers a question
about the passage in front of you, while the application is where extended
research lives — long conversations, many sources, work that outlasts a
reading session.

**This costs something, and the cost is recorded rather than discovered.**

- **§11's Scripture Context cannot cross an origin.** A reader at
  `scrinode.com` selecting ROM.8.28 and opening Zedek at `zedek.scrinode.com`
  is a navigation between applications, not within one. Context must be passed
  explicitly — in the URL, as a reference plus translation — and rebuilt on
  arrival. Never assume shared client state between the two.
- **Two sessions, not one.** §27.3 forbids a cookie scoped to
  `.scrinode.com`, so the reader's session does not authenticate Zedek. Zedek
  runs its own Auth.js instance against the same `users` table.
- **Shared code goes through packages.** `@scrinode/ui` for primitives,
  `@scrinode/scripture` for canon and references, `@scrinode/ai` for provider
  abstraction. Zedek must not import from `apps/web`, and a boundary rule
  enforces it.

### Studies and Conversations

Zedek organises work in two levels, and the names are fixed (§45):

```text
Study          a project — a sermon series, a book study, a research question
└── Conversation   one thread within it
```

A **Study** is a `workspace` (§3.4) with the type `research`. It is not a new
primitive: §24 already has `workspaces`, `conversations` and `messages`, and
§39 says represent relations as rows first. A Conversation belongs to exactly
one Study.

**Memory is per Study, not per Conversation.** A reader researching Romans
across six conversations should not have to re-establish what they are working
on. What persists is the Study's accumulated context — its Scripture range,
its sources, its saved findings — never a raw transcript replayed into the
prompt, which would defeat §19's retrieval and cost tokens for no gain.

### Grounding is not optional

Zedek answers from Scrinode's own data — §19's hybrid retrieval over
`translation_texts` and `retrieval_units`, plus a user's own notes and
workspace content. It is not a general assistant with Bible data attached
(§1).

- A claim about the text must trace to retrieved Scripture, and §16's citation
  validation runs before the response is delivered.
- Retrieval is scoped to what the user may see: only translations
  `isAvailable()` permits (§22.1), and only that user's own notes (§33).
- When retrieval returns nothing relevant, Zedek says so. A model answering
  from its own weights about Scripture is precisely what §2.2 forbids.

## 3.4 Work

Ministry and study creation.

Initial workspace types:

- Sermon.
- Bible study.
- Teaching notes.
- Liturgy.
- Research project.

Future:

- Team workspaces.
- Shared ministry projects.
- Lesson plans.
- Devotionals.
- Courses.
- Presentation flows.

## 3.5 Library

Persistent user knowledge.

Includes:

- Saved passages.
- Highlights.
- Notes.
- Saved studies.
- Zedek conversations.
- Research cards.
- Collections.
- Workspaces.
- Future uploaded resources.

---

# 4. Navigation Contract

The navigation model is fixed unless the product owner explicitly changes it.

## Mobile

```text
Scripture | Study | Zedek | Work | Library
```

Use bottom navigation.

## Tablet / Desktop

Use top navigation with the same IA:

```text
Scrinode | Scripture | Study | Zedek | Work | Library | Profile
```

Profile and settings stay outside the five primary product domains.

Profile is top-right on all supported layouts.

Do not add:

- Settings
- Notifications
- Account
- Billing
- Security

to the bottom nav.

---

# 5. Responsive Design Contract

Scrinode is **mobile-first and desktop-capable**.

## Mobile

- One primary task at a time.
- Bottom navigation.
- Bottom sheets.
- Drawers.
- Compact action rows.
- Thumb-friendly controls.

## Tablet

- Two-pane layouts when context benefits from parallel display.
- Increased persistence of secondary panels.

## Desktop

Use available width productively.

Preferred research pattern:

```text
Bible Navigation | Scripture Text | Study / Zedek / Notes
```

Never merely stretch mobile cards across a desktop screen.

## Mobile-first is a rule about CSS, not an aspiration

Nearly all Scrinode's readers are on phones and tablets. "Mobile-first"
therefore means the phone layout is what the stylesheet says with **no media
query at all**, and every query is a `min-width` that adds capability as space
allows.

- **No `max-width` media queries.** A `max-width` rule is a desktop layout
  apologising to a phone, and it inverts the cascade: the phone pays for
  desktop CSS it then overrides. The landing page has none, and a new one
  should be treated as a design that was built the wrong way round.
- **Never put `display` in a `style` attribute on an element a media query
  governs.** An inline style beats any stylesheet rule, so `display: none` in a
  class silently does nothing. This was a real bug: the product preview's three
  panes carried inline `display: flex`, so a phone rendered all three squeezed
  to one word per line with a horizontal scrollbar, while the CSS that should
  have collapsed them looked correct in review.
- **`html, body { overflow-x: hidden }` is a backstop, not a fix.** Anything
  that overflows is a bug to correct at its source; the guard exists so one
  mistake does not take the whole page down on the devices that matter most.
- **Touch targets are 44px.** §32 requires it, and 2.1rem icon buttons do not
  meet it — a control that only appears on a wide screen is still touched on a
  tablet.
- **A layout that merely shrinks is not responsive.** Three columns squeezed
  into 360px is worse than one column: below its breakpoint the product preview
  drops the navigation rail entirely, because a picture of a nav rail teaches a
  reader nothing and costs a third of the width.
- **Nothing may be reachable by hover alone.** Touch devices have no hover
  state, and they are nearly all of Scrinode's traffic. A hover reveal binds to
  hover, focus *and* activation — which in practice means the thing being
  hovered is a `<button>`, so a tap and the Enter key both work. The landing
  page's capability cards do this.
- **Content revealed by interaction stays in the accessible tree.** A back face
  hidden until a pointer arrives is content a screen-reader user never receives.
  Both faces of a flip card are always in the DOM and neither is `aria-hidden`;
  the effect is purely visual.
- **Honour `prefers-reduced-motion` for anything that moves.** A 3D card
  rotation is precisely the vestibular trigger that setting exists for. Under
  it the cards cross-fade: same information, no movement.

---

# 6. Visual Design Direction

Scrinode should feel:

- Scholarly.
- Calm.
- Reverent.
- Modern.
- Warm.
- Trustworthy.
- Focused.
- Highly readable.

Avoid:

- Loud gradients everywhere.
- Excessive neon.
- "Crypto-dashboard" aesthetics.
- Gamified spiritual language.
- Overly futuristic UI that harms reading.
- Dense enterprise-dashboard clutter.

```

Use accents sparingly.

# 7. Technology Stack

Default stack:

```text
Frontend       Next.js + React + TypeScript
Backend        NestJS + TypeScript
Database       PostgreSQL (Neon, managed)
Vector Search  pgvector (same database)  # 0.8.6 on Neon

Do not replace a core technology without an explicit architectural reason.

---

# 8. Repository Structure

Prefer monorepo organization.

Scrinode has **four applications**.

```text
scrinode/
│
├── apps/
│   ├── web/              Next.js — public reader (scrinode.com)

├── data/
│   ├── imports/
│   ├── fixtures/
│   └── schemas/

└── AGENTS.md
```

Recommended orchestration:

- Turborepo.
- Shared TypeScript configs.
- Shared lint config.
- Shared domain types.
- Shared validation.

## Package naming

Every workspace package is scoped **`@scrinode/*`**. No unscoped names, no ad-hoc prefixes.

```text
@scrinode/web              @scrinode/types         @scrinode/ui
@scrinode/zedek            @scrinode/validation    @scrinode/admin-ui
@scrinode/backoffice       @scrinode/scripture     @scrinode/ai
@scrinode/api              @scrinode/config        @scrinode/eslint-config
```

- The directory name matches the package name after the scope.
- Apps are scoped too, though private and never published.
- Every package sets `"private": true` unless publishing is a deliberate decision.
- Internal dependencies use `workspace:*`, never a version range.
- Import by package name (`@scrinode/scripture`), never a relative path across a package boundary.

## Package boundaries

Enforced by ESLint. A violating import fails `pnpm verify` and fails CI.

```text
@scrinode/web         ✗ @scrinode/admin-ui, @scrinode/backoffice
@scrinode/zedek       ✗ @scrinode/admin-ui, @scrinode/backoffice
@scrinode/backoffice  ✗ @scrinode/web, @scrinode/zedek, @scrinode/scripture
@scrinode/api         ✗ frontend apps and their components
@scrinode/types       ✗ every runtime dependency
apps/api domain code  ✗ the pg driver — use a repository
everywhere but ai/    ✗ vendor AI SDKs — use AIProvider
everywhere            ✗ relative imports across packages
```

Add a package's rules to its `eslint.config`, using `boundaries()` from `@scrinode/eslint-config/boundaries`. When adding a rule, verify it fires: write a deliberate violation, confirm lint fails, then remove it. A rule that cannot fail is not protection.

- `packages/ui` holds genuinely shared primitives.
- Reader-facing domain components (`Verse`, `Passage`, `ScriptureSelection`) stay reader-facing.
- Admin types must not leak into public API response shapes.

See §51 for the backoffice domain rules.

---

# 9. Domain-First Coding Rules

Prefer domain components and services over generic utility sprawl.

Important primitives:

```text
BibleReference
Verse
Passage
ScriptureSelection
Translation
CrossReference
Lexeme
Morphology
Citation
ResearchSource
ResearchCard
ZedekMessage
WorkspaceBlock
SermonBlock
LibraryItem
```

Do not let core biblical concepts become loosely typed strings.

Bad:

```ts
const reference = "Romans 8:28";
```

Preferred:

```ts
type BibleReference = {
  bookId: "ROM";
  chapter: 8;
  verseStart: 28;
  verseEnd?: 30;
};
```

---

# 10. Canonical Scripture Model

Use stable internal reference IDs.

Examples:

```text
GEN.1.1
PSA.23.1
MAT.5.3
JHN.3.16
ROM.8.28
REV.22.21
```

Do not use translated reference labels as database identity.

Canonical concept:

```text
ROM.8.28
│
├── translation texts
├── Greek/Hebrew data
├── cross-references
├── themes
├── historical notes
├── user notes
├── highlights
└── conversations
```

Translation text is a representation of the verse, not the verse entity itself.

---

# 11. Scripture Context

Create and preserve a global Scripture Context.

```ts
interface ScriptureContext {
  reference: BibleReference;
  translation: TranslationCode;

  selection?: {
    startVerse: number;
    endVerse: number;
  };

  selectedText?: string;
  selectedTokens?: string[];

  comparisonTranslations?: TranslationCode[];
}
```

This context must survive navigation between:

```text
Scripture
Study
Zedek
Work
Library
```

Feature implementations should accept `ScriptureContext` when relevant rather than independently parsing URL strings.

---

# 12. Bible Reader Requirements

The Bible Reader is the primary product surface.

MVP requirements:

- Fast chapter loading.
- Clear book and chapter selector.
- Translation selector.
- Verse numbering.
- Word / verse / passage interaction.
- Selected verse state.
- Copy.
- Quote.
- Highlight.
- Save.
- Compare.
- Open Study.
- Ask Zedek.
- Accessible reading controls.
- Responsive typography.

Future-ready requirements:

- Offline reading.
- Reading plans.
- Audio synchronization.
- Interlinear mode.
- Multi-translation compare.
- User annotations.
- Collaborative study.

---

# 13. Verse Inspector

Verse Inspector is a first-class product primitive.

## Mobile

Render as bottom sheet or full-height sheet.

## Desktop

Render as side panel.

Minimum actions:

```text
Copy
Quote
Save
Highlight
Compare
Context
Cross References
Original Language
Word Study
History
Themes
Notes
Ask Zedek
```

Keep the user anchored to the current Scripture.

---

# 14. Search Architecture

Search is universal.

Single input should support:

```text
John 3:16
faith without works
agape
resurrection
Paul and justification
why did Jesus wash the disciples' feet?
```

Supported intent classes:

```text
reference_query
keyword_query
phrase_query
semantic_query
entity_query
original_language_query
theological_question
comparative_query
```

Search principle:

> **Retrieve Scripture first. Interpret second.**

Do not lead semantic queries with AI prose when direct Scripture results are available.

## 14.1 How each class is served

Keyword, phrase and semantic queries use different machinery, and using the
wrong one silently returns worse results rather than failing.

```text
reference_query          parsed, never searched — §42 forbids duplicating this
keyword_query            full-text search over translation_texts.search_vector
phrase_query             full-text, with a phrase operator
semantic_query           pgvector over retrieval_units (§19, §20)
entity_query             phonetic match on proper names, then full-text
original_language_query  lexical data — not yet sourced
```

Rules:

- **Name the text search configuration.** `to_tsvector('scrinode_english', …)`,
  never the one-argument form, which reads a session setting and can produce
  a vector the index does not match.
- **`scrinode_english` strips diacritics before stemming.** Transliterated
  Greek and Hebrew reach the reader with accents nobody types; a search for
  "agape" must find "agápē".
- **Proper names need phonetic matching, and phonetics alone is not enough.**
  Douay-Rheims prints *Isaias* where other editions print *Isaiah*, and
  trigram cannot bridge that. But `dmetaphone` equality fails in both
  directions: *Isaiah* and *Isaias* are `AS` and `ASS`, so equality misses
  them, while `was`, `is`, `as` and `Esau` are all `AS`, so equality matches
  the commonest words in the text. Require both a close phonetic code and a
  length-normalised spelling bound — see `infra/postgres/README.md` for the
  measured form and its numbers.
- **Name the schema of a text search dictionary.** `unaccent` is in `public`
  and `english_stem` in `pg_catalog`; unqualified names resolve against a
  `search_path` a migration does not control. Map `asciiword` as well as
  `word`, or plain English goes unstemmed while accented words appear to
  work.
- **Scope keyword search to a translation.** Unscoped, a hit repeats once per
  translation loaded.

---

# 15. Study Architecture

Study should use structured data whenever possible.

Priority order:

```text
1. Canonical Scripture
2. Structured metadata
3. Original-language datasets
4. Cross-reference datasets
5. Historical / lexical sources
6. Semantic retrieval
7. AI synthesis
```

AI is the final synthesis layer, not the source of truth.

---

# 16. Zedek AI Architecture

Zedek must use orchestration, not a single prompt.

Preferred flow:

```text
User Request
    ↓
Intent Router
    ↓
Scripture Context
    ↓
Structured Retrieval
    ↓
Semantic Retrieval
    ↓
Relevant Tools
    ↓
Context Builder
    ↓
Prompt Assembly
    ↓
AI Provider
    ↓
Citation Validation
    ↓
Streaming Response
```

Potential internal tools:

```text
getPassage()
getContext()
searchBible()
getCrossReferences()
getGreekTokens()
getHebrewTokens()
searchLexicon()
searchResearchCorpus()
getWorkspaceContext()
getUserNotes()
```

## What is implemented

`apps/api/src/zedek` holds the orchestration; `packages/ai` holds the provider
abstraction. Two stages carry most of the weight, and both are enforced by test
rather than convention.

**The intent router decides whether a model is involved at all.** §15 puts AI
last, and `routeQuestion()` is where that becomes real: a bare reference or a
short keyword phrase is refused by Zedek and sent back to the reader or to
search. A free answer is the cheapest kind, and generating one is pure waste.
The router is rule-based — asking a model which model to use pays for an
inference to save one and adds latency ahead of §31's 2s target.

**Citation validation runs after generation, against this turn's retrieval.**
A Scripture citation must trace to a unit that was in the context the model was
given — not merely to a unit that exists. A real verse recalled unaided is
still fabricated, because the grounding is what makes it checkable (§1's VERIFY
step). Invalid citations are **dropped, never repaired**: guessing which unit a
model meant would invent the grounding this exists to require.

A citation's reference, translation and text come from the retrieved row, never
from the response. The model supplies only the unit id.

Rules that hold here:

- **When retrieval returns nothing relevant, no provider call is made.** Zedek
  says it found nothing. Generating anyway would produce an answer from the
  model's own weights, which §2.2 forbids, and would cost money to do it.
- **The relevance floor is measured, not guessed.** Observed scores for correct
  answers ran 0.47-0.68 across ten translations; a correct Leviticus result
  scored 0.47. A cutoff at 0.5 would have discarded it, so the floor sits
  below.
- **Ownership is checked before any work and any token.** §33, and the check is
  in the repository's SQL rather than after the fetch, so a service cannot
  forget it. A missing row and another reader's row are the same error
  deliberately — distinguishing them leaks which ids exist.
- **Reader identity comes from the session, never the request body.** The
  `ReaderGuard` resolves Auth.js's session cookie against the `sessions` table;
  with the database strategy the record is the authority, so no secret is
  needed. It reads no privilege fields, so there is nothing to escalate with
  (§27.3).
- **Cost and token counts are recorded per message and not returned to
  readers.** §34 wants them visible to operators; a per-answer price in the
  interface would change how people ask questions.
- **Without a key, the provider is a loud fake.** It states that it is not a
  real answer rather than returning plausible prose — a reader cannot tell
  fabricated text from a grounded one, which is precisely §2.2's concern. The
  API still boots: a missing Zedek key must not take down the reader.

---

# 17. AI Provider Abstraction

Never couple product logic directly to one LLM provider.

Interface:

```ts
export interface AIProvider {
  generate(input: GenerateInput): Promise<GenerateResult>;

  stream(
    input: GenerateInput
  ): AsyncIterable<AIStreamChunk>;

  embed(input: EmbedInput): Promise<EmbedResult>;
}
```

Adapters may include:

```text
OpenAIProvider
AnthropicProvider
GeminiProvider
LocalProvider
```

## Model roles

Prefer capabilities over model names.

```ts
type AIModelRole =
  | "reasoning"
  | "fast"
  | "embedding"
  | "long-context";
```

Routing example:

```text
reasoning    → strongest reasoning model
fast         → cheap low-latency model
embedding    → embedding model
long-context → large-context model
```

No business logic should depend on vendor-specific response formats.

## Prompt ordering is a cost contract

`packages/ai` assembles prompts from ordered segments rather than letting
callers concatenate strings, and the reason is money.

Every provider's prompt cache matches on a **prefix**. A cache entry is used
only while the leading bytes are byte-identical to an earlier request, and the
match stops at the first difference. So the saving — 70-80% of input tokens on
a multi-turn conversation — is decided entirely by ordering: stable content
first, variable content last.

Put the reader's question or the retrieved units early and the cache never
hits, at roughly 4x the cost, **with no error and no warning**. That silence is
why this is a type rather than a convention:

```text
Stability.Fixed         system prompt, §23 structure, citation rules
Stability.Study         a Study's memory, sources, Scripture range (§3.3)
Stability.Conversation  earlier turns — append-only, so its prefix survives
Stability.Turn          retrieved units, and the question itself
```

Rules:

- **Callers choose segments, never their order.** `assemble()` sorts by
  stability, stably, so ordering within a tier stays the caller's.
- **Do not cache below the provider minimum.** Writing a cache entry costs
  *more* than an uncached request, so a short prefix pays a premium it cannot
  repay. `MIN_CACHEABLE_CHARS` is the floor and `cacheBoundary` returns 0 when
  it is not met.
- **Never replay a raw transcript** (§3.3). It grows linearly, so turn 30
  costs five times turn 5. Summarised Study memory stays flat and cacheable.
- **Account for the three input classes separately.** Cached, cache-write and
  full-rate tokens are billed differently; folding them together hides the
  largest saving in the system, and a caching regression then looks like
  ordinary traffic growth. `cacheHitRate()` is the number to watch — near zero
  on a warm conversation means the ordering is broken.

**The two vendors request caching differently, and that is why the ordering
lives in the prompt rather than in an adapter.**

```text
Anthropic   explicit — a cache_control marker on the last cacheable block,
            and nothing is cached without one. Charges 1.25x to write an
            entry, so a short prefix costs more than not caching.
OpenAI      implicit — matches leading tokens automatically, with nothing in
            the request to say whether it worked. No write premium.
```

Consequences worth keeping:

- **An adapter must not reorder or reformat what `assemble()` produced.** A
  convenience like sorting messages or trimming whitespace breaks OpenAI's
  prefix match silently.
- **Exactly one `cache_control` marker.** Marking every block requests several
  entries and pays several write premiums for one prefix.
- **OpenAI's `prompt_tokens` is the total, cached included.** Reading it as
  uncached input double-counts and reports a cached turn as *more* expensive
  than an uncached one. Asserted by test.
- **A streamed OpenAI call reports no usage unless asked.**
  `stream_options.include_usage` is required, or §34 is blind to exactly the
  requests that stream.
- **A vendor error body never reaches the caller** (§33). It can echo the
  prompt, and prompts carry the reader's own notes.

**Routing is the other order-of-magnitude lever.** `reasoning` costs roughly
ten times `fast`, so `routeRole()` sends restatement to `fast` and reserves
`reasoning` for what §23 actually needs it for: contested theology, comparison
and thematic tracing, where a weaker model picks one reading and sounds
certain. Intent classes answered from Postgres — `reference_query`,
`keyword_query`, `phrase_query` (§14.1) — never reach a model at all, and a
free answer is the cheapest kind.

# 18. Zedek Streaming

Use SSE initially.

Stream event types:

```ts
type ZedekStreamEvent =
  | { type: "status"; message: string }
  | { type: "content"; delta: string }
  | { type: "citation"; citation: Citation }
  | { type: "tool"; tool: string; state: "started" | "completed" }
  | { type: "error"; message: string }
  | { type: "complete"; messageId: string };
```

Safe statuses:

```text
Loading Scripture...
Searching cross-references...
Examining original language...
Searching sources...
Generating response...
```

Never expose private chain-of-thought.

Support cancellation.

---

# 19. RAG Strategy

Do not implement RAG as:

```text
question
→ vector search
→ chunks
→ model
```

Use hybrid retrieval.

```text
Question
  ↓
Reference Parser
  ↓
Structured Retrieval
  +
Vector Retrieval
  +
Metadata Filters
  +
Lexical Data
  +
Cross References
  ↓
Context Builder
  ↓
Model
```

---

# 20. Embedding Strategy

Do not embed isolated verses only.

Create multiple retrieval unit types:

```text
verse
passage
pericope
chapter
topic
entity
lexical entry
historical note
research article
```

Include metadata:

```ts
{
  type: "passage",
  bookId: "PHP",
  referenceStart: "PHP.4.10",
  referenceEnd: "PHP.4.20",
  testament: "NT",
  language: "en",
  sourceId: "...",
  embedding: [...]
}
```

Design for filtered vector search.

---

# 21. Source Provenance

Every imported source must include provenance.

Required shape:

```ts
{
  sourceId: string,
  sourceName: string,
  sourceType: string,
  license?: string,
  attribution?: string,
  sourceUrl?: string,
  importedAt: Date
}
```

Never ingest external biblical or scholarly data without recording licensing and origin.

---

# 22. Translation Integrity

Distinguish:

```text
Published Bible translation
vs.
AI-assisted language translation
```

AI-translated Scripture must be clearly labeled.

Never present AI-generated text as an official Bible version.

## 22.1 Translation licensing

`packages/scripture/src/translations.ts` is the translation registry. It is the
only authority on which translations Scrinode may serve. The sourced terms
behind every entry are in `docs/TRANSLATION_LICENSING.md`.

**`isAvailable()` is the gate.** Registry membership is not permission, and
neither is a permissive licence whose obligations are unimplemented. Never
serve, ingest or cache a translation's text without it.

**Scrinode is a commercial product.** Paid subscription plans, no advertising.
Every publisher treats a subscription as commercial use, so no non-commercial
grant may ever be served — this rules out the free ESV API, API.Bible's free
tier, the NET's gratis licence and Bible Brain. The premise is recorded as
`IS_COMMERCIAL_PRODUCT` and enforced by test.

Rules that are not negotiable:

- A translation absent from the registry fails closed. Never add an entry to
  make a code resolve.
- Never fill in a licence field that a publisher has not stated. `'not-stated'`
  is a real answer and must never be read as permission (§42).
- Required attribution is stored verbatim. Paraphrasing a required notice
  breaches the licence.
- **Fair-use verse limits do not authorise Scrinode.** They govern quoting
  within a work; serving passages on demand is redistribution and needs a
  licence regardless of per-page verse count.
- Zedek retrieves Scripture into model context (§20). Only texts with no
  copyright holder may be retrieved until a publisher grants AI use in writing.

## 22.2 Canon

`books.ts` holds two tiers: `BOOKS` is the 66-book Protestant canon and
`DEUTEROCANONICAL_BOOKS` the 20 additional books the Septuagint, Catholic and
Apocrypha-bearing editions carry. `ALL_BOOKS` is both.

- `getBook` and `isValidBookId` resolve the Protestant canon **only**. Do not
  widen them. Use `getAnyBook` and `isKnownBookId` where both canons are meant.
- A translation's book list is a property of that translation, never an
  assumption the reader may make. Thirteen of the registered sources carry
  deuterocanon; most do not.
- Versification differs between traditions. Brenton's Psalms has 151 chapters,
  Greek Esther 16, Douay-Rheims Daniel 14. Never validate an import against
  the registry's chapter counts, which record Hebrew versification.
- Never invent a book name or chapter count. Both were read from the USFM
  sources (§21); anything new must be too.

## 22.3 Ingestion

`@scrinode/ingest` acquires and loads Scripture text. `docs/BIBLE_INGESTION.md`
records the pipeline and what the archives actually contained.

- Source archives are immutable and addressed by release date. A re-import
  never overwrites earlier bytes: a verse that changes silently under a saved
  note is a correctness failure, not a refresh.
- Keep the publisher's archive and its SHA256. It is what proves the bytes are
  the ones whose licence was verified, and it allows re-parsing without
  returning to the publisher.
- Scripture is never mutated at import. Strip markup, not content — footnotes
  and cross-references are removed entirely (§2), and characters the publisher
  put in the text stay in the text.
- Staging is not permission. Texts may be archived without being registered;
  `isAvailable()` still decides what may be served.
- The ingestion CLI writes to the same database the API reads, through the
  same schema, created by the API's migrations. Run them before loading.

---

# 23. Theological Integrity

Agents must not flatten contested theology into one asserted answer.

For disputed passages or doctrines:

- Present major interpretations.
- Attribute claims.
- Identify textual support.
- Distinguish text, inference, tradition, and application.

Preferred response structure:

```text
Textual observation
Historical / literary context
Major interpretations
Cross references
Source notes
```

Do not invent denominational consensus.

---

# 24. Database Rules

PostgreSQL, accessed through the `pg` driver. No ORM: retrieval depends on
pgvector operators and index settings (`<=>`, `hnsw.ef_search`) that ORMs
either cannot express or express badly, and §19 makes that path load-bearing.

Prefer many narrow tables over wide rows carrying nested JSON.

Conceptual tables:

```text
verses
translation_texts
books
chapters
cross_references
lexemes
morphology
themes
entities
sources
retrieval_units
ingest_runs

users
notes
highlights
collections
conversations
messages
workspaces
workspace_blocks
notification_events
```

Avoid:

- `jsonb` where a column or a table would do. It defeats constraints, typing
  and the planner, and becomes a schema nobody can see.
- An unbounded array column. A conversation's messages are rows.
- Denormalising before a measured need.

Rules:

- **`snake_case` everywhere.** Postgres folds unquoted identifiers to lower
  case; a quoted `"camelCase"` column must then be quoted in every query, and
  the first one forgotten is a runtime error. The only exceptions are the four
  tables Auth.js owns, whose column names its own SQL dictates (§27.1).
- **Constraints belong in the database.** A `CHECK` that rejects a testament
  outside `OT`/`NT` holds against every writer, including a migration and a
  psql session. Application validation does not.
- **Parameterise every value.** Repositories build SQL with `$1`, `$2`; a
  concatenated value is an injection hole no upstream validation closes (§33).
- **Every schema change is a migration**, ordered and reversible. Migrations
  run in a transaction, so a failure leaves nothing behind.

---

# 25. Conversation Storage

Recommended:

```text
conversations
messages
```

Conversation:

```ts
{
  _id,
  userId,
  title,
  scriptureContext,
  createdAt,
  updatedAt
}
```

Message:

```ts
{
  _id,
  conversationId,
  role,
  content,
  citations,
  sources,
  modelMetadata,
  createdAt
}
```

Persist completed assistant messages, not every token.

---

# 26. State Management

Redux Toolkit is for application interaction state.

RTK Query is for remote server state.

Suggested slices:

```text
scriptureSlice
studySlice
zedekSlice
workspaceSlice
preferencesSlice
```

Do not store large Bible corpora in Redux.

---

# 27. Auth Architecture

Scrinode has **two separate identity systems**. They are distinct security domains, not one system with a privilege flag.

```text
Reader identity   apps/web        Auth.js / NextAuth
Admin identity    apps/backoffice separate system, separate collections
```

## 27.1 Reader identity

Use Auth.js / NextAuth.

Initial providers may include:

- Email.
- Google.
- Apple.

Optimized for frictionless sign-up.

Future-ready schema should allow:

```text
User
Organization
Membership
Role
Permission
```

Do not build enterprise organization features in MVP unless required.

## 27.2 Admin identity

Internal staff only. Never the same collection as `users`.

```text
admin_users
admin_sessions
admin_roles
admin_audit_log
```

Requirements:

- Separate session cookie, separate domain.
- Short session expiry.
- MFA required.
- Re-authentication for destructive operations.
- First `superadmin` seeded out-of-band by script. **Never a bootstrap endpoint in the running application.**

## 27.3 Non-negotiable separation

- A reader session token must never authorize an admin route.
- An admin session token must never authorize a reader route.
- A compromised reader account must not be able to escalate to admin.
- No privilege fields on the reader `User` schema.
- **Neither app may set a cookie scoped to a parent domain.** The reader is `scrinode.com` and the backoffice is `admin.scrinode.com`; a cookie with `Domain=.scrinode.com` would be sent to both and hand the backoffice a reader session. Session cookies stay host-only, `HttpOnly`, and never `SameSite=None`.

Both directions must be covered by tests.

## 27.4 RBAC

Check **permissions**, never roles. A role is a named bundle of permissions, so new roles can be added without touching guard logic.

```ts
type Permission =
  | "sources:read"    | "sources:write"
  | "ingestion:run"   | "ingestion:read"
  | "content:review"  | "content:publish"
  | "users:read"      | "users:write"
  | "zedek:configure" | "zedek:read"
  | "flags:write"     | "admin:manage"
  | "audit:read";
```

Initial roles:

```text
superadmin         full access, including admin management and destructive operations
data-admin         source imports, ingestion, licence registry, reindexing
content-moderator  review and publish datasets
support            read-only user lookups; no data mutation
observer           read-only dashboards and metrics
```

---

# 28. Notification Architecture

Use provider abstraction.

```text
NotificationService
├── EmailProvider → Resend
└── SMSProvider   → Termii
```

Domain methods should be vendor-agnostic:

```text
sendVerificationCode()
sendPasswordReset()
sendSecurityAlert()
sendWorkspaceInvite()
sendStudyReminder()
```

Persist delivery metadata for audit and retry.

---

# 29. Background Jobs

Vercel is suitable for interactive workloads.

Heavy work must remain separable.

Examples:

```text
Bible ingestion
embedding generation
vector reindexing
large document processing
bulk imports
source normalization
```

Preferred future model:

```text
Vercel Cron
   ↓
Job Trigger
   ↓
Queue
   ↓
Worker
```

Potential queue:

```text
BullMQ + Redis
```

Do not force heavy batch work into interactive HTTP requests.

---

# 30. Deployment Strategy

## MVP

```text
Next.js    → Vercel          (reader, Zedek and backoffice — three projects)
NestJS     → Vercel          (serverless functions)
PostgreSQL → Neon (managed, us-east-2) — pgvector 0.8.6, PostGIS 3.6
Email      → Resend
SMS        → Termii
```

**Everything runs on Vercel; the database is Neon.** See
`docs/PLAN_vercel_api.md` for the deployment steps and what remains open.

This reverses the droplet topology recorded earlier, and the reasoning is
worth keeping rather than quietly replacing. The droplet was chosen so the API
and Postgres could share a private network. The droplet that exists has 458 MB
of RAM and 8.7 GB of disk, which cannot host Postgres alongside the API, so
the database moved to Neon — and once the database was managed and reached
over TLS, the API's only remaining reason to be on a droplet was portability.

**`main.ts` is kept working, and that is deliberate.** It binds a port and
registers shutdown hooks, so the API still runs as a long-lived server in a
container. A test asserts it. This is what keeps "keep NestJS cloud-portable"
true rather than aspirational.

Rules:

- **Three frontend projects, three origins.** `scrinode.com`,
  `zedek.scrinode.com` and `admin.scrinode.com` are separate Vercel projects.
  Each holds its own session cookie, host-only, never scoped to the parent
  domain (§27.3). All three must appear in the API's `CORS_ORIGINS`, and the
  schema still rejects a wildcard.
- **One security baseline, two entry points.** `main.ts` (server) and
  `api/index.ts` (Vercel) both build the app through `createApp` in
  `app.factory.ts`, which applies helmet, the CORS allow-list, the 1 MB body
  cap and `x-powered-by` removal. A handler that configured its own app would
  silently serve without them, so a test asserts both import the factory and
  neither calls `NestFactory` directly.
- **`DATABASE_URL` uses Neon's pooled host on Vercel.** A function neither
  shares a pool across invocations nor closes connections on shutdown — it is
  frozen, not signalled — so direct connections accumulate until Neon refuses
  them. Measured: the pooled endpoint also connects in half the time.
- **Migrations use the *direct* host, never the pooled one.** `withLock` holds
  an advisory lock on one client while the migration runs on another;
  transaction pooling does not keep that session pinned to a backend, so the
  lock can lapse and two deploys could migrate at once.
- **`DATABASE_SSL=true` always.** The connection crosses the public internet;
  the driver verifies the certificate chain, so this authenticates the server
  as well as encrypting.
- **Rate limiting moves to the edge.** `ThrottlerModule` counts in process
  memory, so on functions its 10/s becomes 10/s *per instance* — no limit
  under load. Vercel WAF enforces it instead, which also avoids invoking a
  function to reject a request. The cost is honest and should not be glossed:
  **those rules live in Vercel project configuration, not in this repository**,
  so they are not reviewable in a diff and CI cannot assert them.
  `docs/PLAN_vercel_api.md` §3 records what production must have.
- **Heavy work stays out of the API** (§29). Ingestion, embedding and
  reindexing run from `@scrinode/ingest` as a CLI. Function limits now make
  this a hard boundary rather than a preference.

**Backups remain unsolved.** Neon provides point-in-time restore within the
plan's retention window; a dump we hold ourselves survives losing the account
and does not exist. `infra/README.md` records the trade honestly — do not
describe backups as implemented.

**The metering risk is unchanged.** Managed, metered storage is what made
Atlas unaffordable (§22.3). Measured on a loaded database: 6,555 B per
embedded unit, so 34 sources is ~8.7 GB with verse-level units and ~2.2 GB
without. `docs/PLAN_neon_cost.md` has the numbers and the levers.

## Scale Path

If needed:

```text
Next.js    → Vercel
NestJS     → Cloud Run / ECS / Railway / Fly.io / Render (main.ts already does this)
Workers    → dedicated worker runtime
PostgreSQL → larger Neon compute, or self-hosted on a sized droplet
```

Keep NestJS cloud-portable.

Avoid unnecessary Vercel-specific coupling in domain code.

---

# 31. Performance Targets

MVP targets:

```text
Initial app shell                 < 2s on healthy mobile connection
Chapter navigation               near-instant from cache
Verse interaction                < 100ms local UI response
Search first meaningful result   < 1.5s target
Zedek first stream chunk         < 2s target when retrieval allows
Common API response              < 500ms excluding external AI calls
```

Use caching carefully.

Do not cache user-sensitive data globally.

---

# 32. Accessibility

Target WCAG 2.2 AA.

Required:

- Keyboard navigation.
- Focus-visible states.
- Semantic HTML.
- Screen-reader labels.
- Accessible modals.
- Accessible bottom sheets.
- Touch targets.
- Text scaling.
- Reduced motion.
- Non-color state indicators.
- Contrast-safe dark mode.

---

# 33. Security

Minimum requirements:

- Secure auth cookies.
- CSRF protection where relevant.
- Input validation.
- Rate limiting.
- Resource ownership checks.
- API authorization.
- XSS protection.
- Rich-text sanitization.
- Secrets outside source control.
- Prompt-injection safeguards.
- Source-trust boundaries.
- Audit logging for sensitive changes.
- Provider key rotation capability.

## Implemented baseline

Verified by tests in `apps/e2e/tests/security.spec.ts`; changing any of it fails CI.

```text
API           helmet, explicit CORS allow-list (wildcard rejected by schema),
              rate limiting (10/s, 120/min) with health exempt, 1 MB body cap,
              no x-powered-by
Reader        nonce-based CSP via middleware (no unsafe-inline for scripts),
              DENY framing, nosniff, strict-origin-when-cross-origin, HSTS,
              Permissions-Policy
Backoffice    stricter CSP, noindex, DENY framing, no-referrer, HSTS
```

Rules:

- **Never widen a CSP to `'unsafe-inline'` for scripts.** Use a nonce. The reader renders Scripture, user notes and AI output, none of which may execute.
- **Never set a wildcard CORS origin.** The API serves credentialed requests; the schema rejects `*` and any origin carrying a path.
- Health endpoints stay exempt from rate limiting: a throttled probe reads as an outage.
- Keep `pnpm audit --prod` clean. Dev-only advisories are acceptable; a vulnerable runtime dependency is not.

## Admin security

The backoffice has write access to everything. It gets the strictest treatment in the product.

- Every mutating admin action writes an audit entry: actor, action, target, before/after, timestamp, IP.
- The audit log is **append-only**. No role, including `superadmin`, may delete from it.
- Audit logging ships **before** any admin feature that mutates data. Never leave a window where admin actions are unattributable.
- Destructive operations require `superadmin` **and** explicit typed confirmation.
- Bulk operations support dry-run mode and batched, rate-limited writes.
- Heavy admin jobs go to the queue, never an interactive HTTP request (§29).
- Admin routes are namespaced under `/admin/*` with a **global module guard** — not per-route decorators, which are easy to forget.
- Admin routes carry their own rate limits.

---

# 34. Observability

Implement early.

Track:

```text
frontend errors
backend errors
request IDs
API latency
search latency
vector query latency
AI provider latency
token usage
AI cost
provider failures
notification delivery
job failures
```

Recommended:

```text
Sentry
structured NestJS logs
AI request metadata
```

# 36. Explicit MVP Non-Goals

Do not delay MVP for:

- Advanced church-team collaboration.
- Native iOS / Android apps.
- Large-scale commentary marketplace.
- Advanced manuscript criticism.
- Full seminary LMS.
- Presentation software.
- Complex biblical maps.
- Audio synchronization.
- Offline-first architecture.
- Multi-tenant enterprise admin (customer-facing organization administration — see note below).
- Real-time collaborative editing.
- Social feed.
- AI autonomous sermon publishing.

Prepare architecture for these only where cheap and sensible.

## Note on "multi-tenant enterprise admin"

This non-goal refers to **customer-facing** organization administration — churches and seminaries managing their own members, shared libraries and permissions.

It does **not** refer to the internal admin backoffice (§51), which is operational tooling for Scrinode staff. These are unrelated. The non-goal stands.

---

---

# 38. Data Growth Strategy

Design ingestion pipelines so sources can be added without schema rewrites.

Preferred pattern:

```text
Raw Source
   ↓
Normalization
   ↓
Validation
   ↓
Provenance
   ↓
Canonical Mapping
   ↓
Search Index
   ↓
Vector Index
```

Never let imported data bypass validation.

---

# 39. Knowledge Graph Readiness

Do not require a graph database in MVP.

Represent relations as rows first.

Examples:

```ts
{
  subjectId: "PAUL",
  relation: "APPEARS_IN",
  objectId: "ACT.9.1"
}
```

or:

```ts
{
  sourceReference: "MAT.4.4",
  relation: "QUOTES",
  targetReference: "DEU.8.3"
}
```

Move to specialized graph infrastructure only when graph-query complexity justifies it.

---

# 40. API Design Principles

APIs should be:

- Typed.
- Versionable.
- Domain-oriented.
- Stable.
- Validation-first.
- Pagination-aware.
- Cursor-based where appropriate.

Examples:

```text
GET /scripture/:translation/:book/:chapter
GET /scripture/reference/:reference
GET /study/context/:reference
GET /study/cross-references/:reference
GET /study/original-language/:reference
POST /search
POST /zedek/conversations
POST /zedek/conversations/:id/messages
GET /library
POST /workspaces
```

Avoid highly generic endpoints like:

```text
POST /do-ai
POST /data
```

---

# 41. Testing Strategy

Minimum layers:

## Unit

- Reference parsing.
- Citation formatting.
- Scripture context.
- Search routing.
- AI provider adapters.
- Validation.
- permissions.

## Integration

- PostgreSQL repositories.
- Vector search.
- Auth.
- Zedek orchestration.
- Notifications.

## E2E

Critical flows:

```text
Open Bible
Navigate to passage
Select verse
Open Study
Ask Zedek
Save note
Create sermon
Add passage
Return to Library
```

Use realistic biblical fixtures.

---

# 42. Agent Working Style

Agents should:

- Inspect existing code before changing architecture.
- Reuse domain primitives.
- Preserve naming consistency.
- Avoid speculative migrations.
- Prefer incremental implementation.
- Add tests for domain logic.
- Document major decisions.
- Explain breaking changes.
- Keep generated code production-oriented.

Agents should not:

- Introduce a new framework without need.
- Replace the chosen stack casually.
- Duplicate reference parsing.
- Hard-code vendor SDK calls into business logic.
- Store secrets in code.
- fabricate Bible data.
- invent licensing terms.
- turn Zedek into an ungrounded chatbot.
- redesign primary IA without explicit approval.

---

# 43. Agent Change Protocol

Before a major change:

1. Identify impacted domain.
2. Identify current contracts.
3. Check data migration implications.
4. Check mobile and desktop UX.
5. Check source provenance.
6. Check Zedek implications.
7. Check backwards compatibility.

# 45. Product Language

Preferred terminology:

```text
Scripture
Study
Zedek
Work
Library
Passage
Verse
Reference
Original Language
Cross References
Context
Research
Workspace
Source
Citation
```

Avoid confusing overlapping labels.

Use **Backoffice** for the internal admin application. Not "admin panel", "dashboard", or "CMS".

Use **Zedek AI** formally and **Zedek** conversationally.

Examples:

```text
Ask Zedek
Study with Zedek
Continue in Zedek
Explain with Zedek
```

---

# 46. Product North Star

Scrinode should eventually become:

> **A Scripture-native operating system for Bible study, theological research, preaching, teaching, and ministry preparation.**

This does not mean adding every possible feature.

It means building a coherent biblical knowledge environment where:

```text
Scripture
Research
AI
User Knowledge
Ministry Work
```

remain connected through one shared reference system.

# 47. Long-Term Architectural Vision

Future architecture may evolve toward:

```text
                    SCRINODE PLATFORM

                           │
                    Application Shell

              └────────────┼────────────┘

                  Provider Abstraction
                           │
             ┌─────────────┼─────────────┐
             │             │             │
          Reasoning       Fast       Embeddings
                           │
                      Tool Layer
                           │
                 External Integrations
```

The architecture should grow toward this model gradually.

Do not implement the full future system during MVP.

# 48. The Final Rule

When there is uncertainty about a technical or product decision, ask:

> **Does this make it easier for the user to understand, study, verify, save, and work with Scripture?**

If not, it is probably not core to Scrinode.

---

# 49. Definition of Success

Scrinode succeeds when a user can:

```text
Open Scripture
→ understand what they are reading
→ inspect its context
→ examine its language
→ discover related Scripture
→ ask intelligent questions
→ verify the answer
→ save what matters
→ turn research into ministry work
```

without feeling that the Bible has become secondary to the software.

---

# 50. Closing Principle

> **Build Scrinode as a Bible platform first, an AI product second, and an extensible ministry operating system third.**

---

# 51. Admin Backoffice

`apps/backoffice` is Scrinode's **internal** operations application. Staff only.

Deployed as a separate Vercel project at `admin.scrinode.com`.

## 51.1 Purpose

The backoffice exists because the specification already requires capabilities that have no interface:

```text
Source & licence registry          §21 — provenance on every import
Ingestion pipeline operation       §38 — normalize → validate → provenance → index
Background job triggering          §29 — ingestion, embeddings, reindexing
Content moderation & curation      cross-references, themes, historical notes
User administration                support lookups, account state
Zedek operations                   model roles, prompts, cost, flagged answers
Feature flags                      production readiness baseline
Observability dashboards           §34 — AI cost, token usage, provider failures
```

## 51.2 Boundaries

- The backoffice is **not a sixth product domain**. The user-facing IA remains Scripture / Study / Zedek / Work / Library (§3, §4) and is unchanged.
- The backoffice never appears in product navigation.
- Admin code never ships in the public bundle.
- The backoffice is internal tooling, not a customer-facing feature.

## 51.3 Shared API, isolated module

Both frontends use the same `apps/api`. One data-access layer, one set of domain services, one source of truth for validation.

Isolation within that shared API is **mandatory** — see §27.3 and §33.

## 51.4 Ingestion safety

Imported data must never be written directly to live canonical collections.

```text
Import → staging collection → validate → review → publish
```

This enforces §38: never let imported data bypass validation.

Publication must be atomic and reversible.

## 51.5 What must never be built into the backoffice

- A bootstrap endpoint that creates the first admin.
- Any path that grants a reader account admin privileges.
- Deletion of audit log entries.
- Unbatched bulk writes against production collections.
- Destructive operations without `superadmin` and typed confirmation.
- Direct writes to canonical Scripture collections that bypass the staging pipeline.

## 51.6 Implementation staging

See `docs/PLAN_backoffice_architecture.md` for the full staged plan.

Sequence is deliberate: **identity → audit log → shell → features**. Audit logging precedes every mutating feature so no admin action is ever unattributable.
