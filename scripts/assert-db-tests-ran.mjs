/**
 * Fails the build if the database integration suites were skipped.
 *
 * A skipped suite and a passing suite look identical in a CI summary: both
 * are green. These suites cover migrations, the Auth.js adapter schema and
 * accent-insensitive search — the parts most likely to break silently — and
 * they skip themselves when TEST_DATABASE_URL is unset, which is right
 * locally and unacceptable in CI.
 *
 * An earlier version of this check lived inline in the workflow and grepped
 * vitest's stdout for `"numPendingTests":0`. The JSON reporter writes to a
 * *file* and prints only its path, so the grep never matched and the check
 * failed unconditionally — including when the database was healthy. It is a
 * script now so it can be run and proven outside CI.
